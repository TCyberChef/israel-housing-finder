- Israeli address geocoding needs free-tier testing with Mapbox/HERE APIs (Phase 9)
- Facebook scraping may require manual aggregation MVP due to auth complexity (Phase 7)
- Legal compliance for Israeli Privacy Protection Law needs validation before storing data (Phase 2)
- Supabase 500MB free tier requires aggressive deduplication from day one (Phase 2/3)
